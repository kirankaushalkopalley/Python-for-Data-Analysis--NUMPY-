# Python for Data Analysis - NUMPY

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

In general, NumPy library is used for working with Arrays. It also has a lot of advanced 
functions that can be used while working with Linear Algebra, Fourier Transformations
and Matrices.




## Installation

Install via PIP
```bash
  pip install numpy
```

Install via CONDA
```bash
  conda create -n my-env
  conda activate my-env
  conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
  conda install numpy
```
## Documentation

This repository is a collection of all the different usecases which involve functions
in Arrays (both 1D & 2D), how to use array indexing and accordingly selecting the values 
within an Array.

Along with the basic transformations, we can also use several mathematical operations 
on Arrays. The clear understanding of syntax and examples are well documented within 
the code.
